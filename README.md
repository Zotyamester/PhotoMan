# PhotoMan

PhotoMan is a CLI tool for basic image manipulation.
It can perform elementary operations (darkening, lighting, contrast adjustment, blurring) on standard image files in a console interface environment, i.e. it can perform the tasks specified by the switches on the file received as a command line argument and then write the modified image back to the background.
